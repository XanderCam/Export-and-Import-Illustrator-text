# Export-and-Import-Illustrator-text
A script for importing and exporting text in an Illustrator document using JSON format. To ease translating or other external need to edit text.

The script will search for text in an Adobe Illustrator document and export it to JSON format.
The script will import JSON formatted text back into the Illustrator Document.

It was designed to help creating multilanguage documents in a quick and easy manner.
It is recommended to test the JSON file in an online validator (such as https://codebeautify.org/json-fixer) 
before importing it back into Illustrator to avoid import errors.
